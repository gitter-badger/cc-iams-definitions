# IAMS Definitions
This repository is created to attempt to store data about malicious ComputerCraft scripts. The goal is to hold the following:
* Hashes of malicious scripts.
* Hashes of Pastebin IDs of malicious scripts. (if applicable)
* Malicious Script IDs. (if applicable)
* Known malicious API calls.

The data in this repository is meant to be non-application specific. There is documentation, which is meant for viewing through GitHub, and then there are the definitions themselves, which are going to be packaged in a format adhering to CraftOS Standards (as defined by oeed).

Please DO NOT submit malicious scripts here. If you have a malicious script, please respectfully disclose it here: [todo malicious program form]. Please also avoid from posting malicious script IDs or anything else that directly links to a malicious script on the CC forums thread, as that could potentially get the thread banned.
